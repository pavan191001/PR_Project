Wine Quality Analysis

Here we will classify the wine on the basis of giving features. We used the wine quality dataset 
downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for 
affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of several Machine learning models, we will classify the
wine.

We use classification techniques to check further the correlation of fundamental features like

        • fixed acidity

        • volatile acidity

        • citric acid

        • residual sugars

        • chlorides

        • free sulphur dioxide

        • density

        • pH

        • sulphates

        • alcohol

        • total sulphur dioxide

        • quality
